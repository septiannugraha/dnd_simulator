## Development Tips

### Week-by-Week Focus
1. **Weeks 1-2**: Get basic server running with auth
2. **Weeks 2-3**: Campaign system working end-to-end  
3. **Weeks 3-4**: Character creation polished and bug-free
4. **Weeks 4-5**: Real-time features stable under load
5. **Weeks 5-6**: Game sessions structured and functional
6. **Weeks 6-8**: AI integration delivering quality responses
7. **Weeks 8-9**: Polish and testing for MVP launch

### Risk Mitigation
- **AI Response Quality**: Start with simple prompts, iterate based on actual gameplay
- **WebSocket Complexity**: Use proven libraries (Socket.IO), implement reconnection early
- **Database Performance**: Index frequently queried fields, implement caching for character data
- **User Experience**: Test with real D&D players early and often

### Launch Readiness Checklist
- [ ] 5+ complete test campaigns with real players
- [ ] AI consistently generates appropriate responses
- [ ] No data loss during typical gaming sessions
- [ ] New user onboarding tested and refined
