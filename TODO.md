## üêõ Known Issues

1. WebSocket disconnection doesn't always reconnect properly
2. Character HP can go negative (should stop at 0)
3. Some race/class combinations don't calculate stats correctly
4. AI responses occasionally reference wrong character names
5. Session state not fully restored after server restart

## üìù Technical Debt

1. Refactor WebSocket message types to use proper enums
2. Move hardcoded values to configuration
3. Implement proper error types instead of string errors
4. Add database migrations system
5. Centralize validation logic
6. Add request/response logging middleware

## üîç Research Needed

1. Best practices for WebRTC integration (future voice chat)
2. Efficient storage for session recordings
3. AI fine-tuning for D&D specific responses
4. Virtual tabletop integration possibilities
5. D&D Beyond API integration options

## üìä Performance Targets

- [ ] Sub-100ms API response times
- [ ] Support 100+ concurrent sessions
- [ ] AI response under 5 seconds
- [ ] WebSocket message latency < 50ms
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for production

## üöÄ Release Checklist
